Work Education

While spending a year in rural Queensland I had the opportunity to get some real-world education through Keystone Architects. I had met with the founder of Keystone, Marian Graham, who is the principle architect of the firm and a Fellow of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects - she allowed me to follow the life cycle of a project that had just began construction. 
The project was multistorey classrooms extending from an existing building at a Christian college.

Week-by-week I visited the site with the architect assigned to the project and observed their role in relation to contract administration and all things relating to the project. I was able to participate within discussion between the architect, engineers, electricians, foreman, etc.
It was an invaluable experience being able to talk directly to all tradespeople involved within the construction process and see their insights into how a design translates from paper into the real world. I believe that their feedback was essential for me in developing a practical mindset for keeping my thought process in a tangible real world setting.
It was evident through the whole process how necessary it is for clear communication between all disciplines involved. Most issues or mistakes that would arise would generally be due to miscommunication or misinterpretation. 
This was especially cost/time wasteful when the plans of different disciplines would not align correctly and would result in the workers having to spend time re-doing things.

Overall I am very grateful for the opportunity to get my head back into the world of Architecture and learn the role that is expected of an Architect. As well as now having a solid database of sorts of different construction methods and references for various fittings, finishings, etc.
