"I enjoy hands-on and digital creative projects in my spare time."


When inspiration strikes or I think of a perfect gift for someone, I love trying to find ways to bring my ideas into reality. I love woodworking and hope to have my own personal workshop one day. For now I enjoy struggling with pallet wood and hand tools on the ground if it still means I get to create.

I especially love creating in Photoshop, of which I have made chirstmas cards for friends for the past few years.
I am trying to improve my skills in other mediums as well, especially watercolours at the moment. I feel most like myself when thinking and acting creatively.
