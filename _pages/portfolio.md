I studied at Griffith University's Gold Coast Campus in the newly built Architecture and Engineering building in the third intake of their Bachelor of Environmental Design (Architectural Studies). Which is now called the Bachelor of Architectural Design after their accreditation process succeeded. 
I was able to choose what was shown on my degree, whether it be Environmental Design (Architecture) or Architectural Design and chose the former. I really enjoyed and respected the environmentally focused course content we had being under the School of Environment and wanted my credentials to reflect this. I am passionate about our planet and love that I can be within an industry that so often innovates in respect to our environment.
