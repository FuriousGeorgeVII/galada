#### Stephen Philippe Drew
<small>Bachelor of Environmental Design (Architecture)</small>

  
I am an Architecture graduate looking to kick-start my career after pursuing life experiences through travel over the past few years.
Having studied a Bachelor of Environmental Design, I have a passion for sustainability and the use of passive design that provide effective solutions in our ever-changing climate.
I love design in all walks of life, whether it be through travelling the world and experiencing the various ways different nations express their culture through Art and Architecture or just designing and constructing furniture for my home. I feel that design is an integral part of life, whether it's noticeable or not.

#### Travel
<small>15 Countries and Counting</small>

I am lucky enough to have the privilege of being able to travel and explore the world. I am always in awe of different landscapes, foods, architecture and culture that travelling lets me experience. I hope that through my life the number of countries I will visit will continuously grow and the experiences that I will have will forever be memorable.
